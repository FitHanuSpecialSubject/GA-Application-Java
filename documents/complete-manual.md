# **3\. Module Specifications**

### **3.1 SMT (Stable Matching Theory)**

The many-to-many variation differs from the original problem defined by Gale and Shapley by introducing individuals' capacity. Therefore, the model is represented in the system as follows:

- Capacities
- Properties
  - Value
  - Weight
  - Requirement
- Set indices
- Exclude pairs
- Evaluate functions
- Fitness function

#### **Evaluate Function**

The **Evaluate function** is specific to individuals within a set, used to compute the preference of one individual over others based on the components of the individual's properties. The details of the calculation are described [preference here].

#### **Exclude Pair**

The **Exclude pair** functionality stops two specific individuals from being matched.

#### **Capacity**

The **Capacity** refers to the maximum number of matches an individual may have.

#### **Fitness Function**

The **Fitness function** calculates the final score from the list of preferences from the matching result. By default, this is the sum of the list.

#### **Set Index**

The **Set index** is a list of integers indicating an individual's set. For example: `[1, 1, 2]` means the 1st and 2nd individuals belong to Set 1, while the 3rd individual belongs to Set 2.

#### **Flow of Event**

With each iteration, a queue of individuals is used to generate stable matching, which is then used to calculate fitness. The order of the queue will be adjusted by the Genetic Algorithm.

```plantuml
@startuml
start
  :queue;
  partition "evaluate" {
    :stable matching;
    :matches;
    :preferences;
    if (exclude pairs exist?) then (yes)
      :reduce fitness;
    else (no)
    endif
  }
  :fitness;
stop
@enduml

```

### **Stable Matching**

As mentioned, the system expands on the original problem by introducing many-to-many matching. This requires some modification to the Gale-Shapley Algorithm.

```plantuml
@startuml
start
  :queue;
  partition "stable matching" {
    repeat :dequeue;
    :individual a;
    :preference list;
    repeat :individual b;
    if (b is full?) then (no)
      if (a is full?) then (no)
        :match a and b;
      else (yes)
        if (a prefers b over any current match?) then (yes)
          :unmatch less prefer;
          :match a and b;
        else (no)
        endif
      endif
    else (yes)
      if (b prefers a over any current match?) then (yes)
        if (a is full?) then (no)
          :match a and b;
        else (yes)
          if (a prefers b over any current match?) then (yes)
            :unmatch less prefer;
            :match a and b;
          else (no)
          endif
        endif
      else (no)
      endif
    endif
    repeat while (preference list has next?) is (yes) not (no)
    repeat while (queue empty?) is (no)
    -> yes;
  }
  :matches;
stop
@enduml
```

## **Preference<<preference>>**

The preference of individual A to individual B is based on 3 factors:

- **Requirement**
- **Value**
- **Weight**

These factors are presented in every property of an individual and are used by the Evaluate function to calculate preference.

---

### Example

| Individual A | Weight | Value | Requirement |
| :----------: | :----: | :---: | :---------: |
|  Property 1  |   12   |  12   |     12      |
|  Property 2  |   13   |  13   |     13      |
|  Property 3  |   23   |  18   |   18:100    |

| Individual B | Weight | Value | Requirement |
| :----------: | :----: | :---: | :---------: |
|  Property 1  |   12   |  12   |     12      |
|  Property 2  |   13   |  13   |     13      |
|  Property 3  |   23   |  18   |   18:100    |

### Common Annotation

- $R_i$ represents the Requirement for Property $i$
- $W_i$ represents the Weight for Property $i$
- $P_i$ represents the Value for Property $i$

Example: $R_1$ means Requirement of Property 1

---

### Custom Evaluation

A custom evaluation function is:

The values of $R_2$ and $W_1$ are taken from Individual A, and $P_1$ is taken from Individual B.

- $W_1$ and $P_1$ are straightforward, while $R_2$ has more nuance.
- The syntax rules give different results for Requirement calculations:

1. $x--$ returns $x$
2. $x:y$ returns $\frac{x + y}{2}$

3. $x++$ returns $x$
4. $x$ returns $x$

Using these rules, the preference of A to B is calculated as:

$13 + 12 * 12 = 157$

---

### Default Evaluation

Default evaluation uses all properties to calculate preference. The formulation can be expressed as:


$$P_A(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i(P_i) \times W_i$$


Where:

- $N$ is the number of properties of an individual
- $R_i$ is the requirement function for property $ i $ of A
- $W_i$ is the weight for property $ i $ of A
- $P_i$ is the value for property $ i $ of B

---

### Requirement Functions

1. 
$$
R_i(P_i) = x - - (P_i) =
\begin{cases} 
2 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
0 & \text{if } P_i > x \\
\frac{x + |P_i - x|}{x} & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

2. 
$$
R_i(P_i) = x + + (P_i) =
\begin{cases} 
2 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
0 & \text{if } P_i < x \\
\frac{x + |P_i - x|}{x} & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

3. 
$$
R_i(P_i) = x : y (P_i) =
\begin{cases} 
\frac{|y - x|}{2} - \frac{|x + y|}{2} + \frac{|P_i|}{|y - x|} + 1 & \text{if } P_i \in [x, y] \\
0 & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

4. 
$$
R_i(P_i) = x(P_i) =
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } P_i < 0 \text{ or } P_i > 10 \\
0 & \text{if } |P_i - x| > 7 \\
1 & \text{if } |P_i - x| > 5 \\
\frac{10 - |P_i - x|}{11} & \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$

---

### Apply These Rules

Letâ€™s now apply these rules to calculate the preference of A to B.

$$
P_A(B) = R_1(P_1) * W_1 + R_2(P_2) * W_2 + R_3(P_3) * W_3
$$

Substituting the values from the tables:


This simplifies to:

$$
= \frac{12 + |12 - 12|}{12} * 12 + 0 * 13 + \left( \frac{100 - 18}{2} - \frac{100 + 18}{2} + 1 \right) * 23
$$

Which results in:

$$
= 12 + 0 + 23 = 35
$$

### **3.2 GT (Game Theory)**

As mentioned above, the sole game representation is in **Normal form**, where all players make decisions simultaneously or don't have information about others' decisions. The most notable example is the "Prisoners' Dilemma" problem.

This model is emulated by the system using the provided data:

- Number of players
- Payoff function
- Fitness function
- Special player
- Strategy and their property matrix
- Conflict

After these data are provided to the system, the payoff of each player's strategies are calculated with the payoff function. Note that the same strategy can have different payoffs with different values. It can be interpreted as:

|          | Strategy 1 | Strategy 2 |
| :------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Player 1 |    100     |     45     |
| Player 2 |     78     |    244     |

Details about how payoffs are calculated are explained in payoff.

_Conflict_ is an additional functionality that discourages any two players from choosing specific strategies at any iteration.

---

### **Flow of Event**

With each iteration, all the players simultaneously make a decision, which has their corresponding payoff. Then the chosen **Genetic Algorithm** will use the fitness function to evaluate the payoffs list.

Here is how fitness is calculated:

```plantuml
@startuml
start
  :strategies;
  partition "evaluate" {
    :payoffs;
    :fitness;
    if (conflicts exist?) then (yes)
      :reduce fitness;
    else (no)
    endif
  }
  :fitness;
stop
@enduml

```

### **Payoff <<payoff>>**

The strategies available to any player can be represented as a table as follows:

|            | Property 1 | Property 2 |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Strategy A | 188        | 1.2        |
| Strategy B | 19.7       | 129        |

Payoff is calculated using the payoff function, which defaults to the sum of a strategy's properties or a custom function using the syntax `=p<column index>[<arithmetic>]`. The index starts from 1.
